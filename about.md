Welcome to my blog! My name is Jahleel Townsend. I am a computer science major at NYU in my final semester as I initially create these blog posts. Please continue to follow and enjoy what I post!

### More Information

One of my current goals is to become proficient with full-stack web development, beginning with frontend work. For me, and likely many others, backend work is easier to get a grasp on, so I would like to focus on becoming proficient with designing intuitive and reactive UIs for a seamless user experience!
